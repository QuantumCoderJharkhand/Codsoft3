# Credit Card Fraud Detection

A Machine Learning project to detect **fraudulent credit card transactions** using Python and Kaggle's credit card dataset.  


## Project Overview
Fraud detection is a critical challenge in the financial sector. This project builds classification models to detect fraudulent transactions by:
- Preprocessing and normalizing the dataset
- Handling **class imbalance** (undersampling / SMOTE)
- Training **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models
- Evaluating performance with **Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrices**



## Technologies Used
- Python 
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- (Optional) Imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE)

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).  
- **Rows:** 284,807 transactions  
- **Fraud Cases:** 492 (0.17% of total)
